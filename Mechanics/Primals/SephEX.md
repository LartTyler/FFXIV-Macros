So just a quick recap, so we're all on the same page...<wait.3>
For stack, DPS left, healers / OT right.<wait.2>
If in doubt, DPS can follow cross.<wait.1>
/marking cross <8><wait.2>
And healers / OT can follow circle.<wait.1>
/marking circle <1><wait.3>
For AoEs during phase 1, purple should go right behind Seph's butt.<wait.4>
For colors, please call out which tower you plan on taking. A quick L or R in chat will suffice.<wait.3>
And for earthshakers, DPS split left, healers split right.<wait.4>
Remember, shakers are proximity based, so try to be all the way to the edge, at about the back 25% of the arena.<wait.2>
Any questions, comments, concerns, or complaints?
